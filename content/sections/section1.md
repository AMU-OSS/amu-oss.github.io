## About AMU-OSS

AMU-OSS is a community of people, who love to talk about all kinds of software development and tech stuff. Besides being an ever-active place to interact with other developers, there's more to it. One way to evolve, is to keep learning on our own.

The other one, however, involves touching base with other people who share the common interest. That's what this community offers - an exposure to the tech domain.

The stuff we discuss here, ranges all the way from open-source development to general programming practices. Be it machine learning, competitive programming, or getting industrial experiences, we have something for you.

Being a student, nothing possibly proves more worthy than the profound insights and experiences that our seniors and alumni have to offer.

So, whether you have just started in programming, or are a code-veteran, we are happy to meet you! We host seminars every Wednesday - where we share our leaning journey, or a cool project we've been working on. Also, there's an online chat-based training session every Sunday, where we plan to teach everything from Python to communication guidelines.

The only requirement is curiosity (and a laptop, with Linux installed), and the only investment is your time.
