{{< faq "What is AMU-OSS?" >}}
AMU-OSS is the Open Source Software Community of Aligarh Muslim University. It is a community of people, who love to talk about all kinds of software development and tech stuff. Besides being an ever-active place to interact with other developers, there’s more to it. One way to evolve, is to keep learning on our own.

{{< faq "How to join this community?" >}}
Just enter your email address at this [invite link](https://slack-invite-automated.herokuapp.com) and follow the instructions in the email.
The first thing you should do after joining Slack is introduce yourself in the #introduction channel. It doesn’t have to be an essay (although, we’d love to know as much as you can tell). It can simply be a couple of lines stating your name, what are your interests, how you came to know about us, etc.
